# noir-nvim

A NeoVim plugin providing syntax highlighting and LSP support for Noir

To install this plugin, follow the standard steps for the plugin manager you are using.

For the LSP to work, ensure you have `nargo` reachable in your PATH, and ensure
that the `nargo lsp` command works in a terminal. From there, the LSP should be automatically
started when a `*.nr` file is opened.
